# Deep Learning Specialization

This repository contains the code, assignments, and resources for the Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera. The specialization is developed by deeplearning.ai and consists of a series of courses that cover various aspects of deep learning.

## Courses

The Deep Learning Specialization is divided into the following courses:

1. Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning
2. Course 2: Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization, and Optimization
3. Course 3: Structuring Machine Learning Projects
4. Course 4: Convolutional Neural Networks
5. Course 5: Sequence Models

Each course provides in-depth knowledge and hands-on experience with deep learning techniques, algorithms, and architectures.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Deep Learning Specialization, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/deeplearning-specialization/deeplearning-coursera.git.
2. Install the required dependencies. Each course may have specific dependencies, which will be mentioned in the respective course folders.
3. Navigate to the specific course folder and explore the available resources, including code templates, and assignments.
4. Complete the assignments and submit them as instructed in the course. The assignments are designed to solidify your understanding and provide hands-on experience with the covered topics.

## Requirements

The requirements for each course may vary. Generally, you will need the following to run the code and complete the assignments:

- Python (version 3.6 or later)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- TensorFlow (version 2.x)
- Keras
- Other course-specific dependencies (mentioned in the respective course folders)

It is recommended to set up a virtual environment to manage the dependencies for each course.

## Additional Resources

In addition to the code and assignments provided in this repository, you may find the following resources helpful:

- [Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) - Enroll in the specialization on Coursera to access the video lectures, quizzes, and graded assignments.

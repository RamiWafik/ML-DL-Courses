# NLP Specialization on Coursera by DeepLearning.AI

This repository contains my solutions and notes for the NLP Specialization offered by DeepLearning.AI on Coursera.

## About the NLP Specialization

The NLP Specialization is a series of courses that cover various topics in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The specialization is designed to provide a comprehensive and practical introduction to NLP techniques and applications.

## Courses
The Natural Language Processing Specialization is dicvided into the following courses:

1. Course 1: Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces

2. Course 2: Natural Language Processing with Probabilistic Models

3. Course 3: Natural Language Processing with Sequence Models

4. Course 4: Natural Language Processing with Attention Models

Each course provides in-depth knowledge and hands-on experience with NLP techniques, algorithms, and architectures.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- Each course has its own directory.
- Inside each course directory, you will find the assignments and any additional resources related to that course.

## Getting Started

To get started with the NLP Specialization, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/nlp-specialization.git`
2. Install the required dependencies. Each course may have specific dependencies, which will be mentioned in the respective course folders.
3. Navigate to the specific course folder and explore the available resources, including code templates, and assignment.
4. Complete the assignments and submit them as instructed in the course. The assignments are designed to solidify your understanding and provide hands-on experience with the covered topics.

## Requirements

The requirements for each course may vary. Generally, you will need the following to run the code and complete the assignments:

- Python (version 3.6 or later)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- TensorFlow (version 2.x)
- Keras
- Other course-specific dependencies (mentioned in the respective course folders)

It is recommended to set up a virtual environment to manage the dependencies for each course.

## Additional Resources

In addition to the code and assignments provided in this repository, you may find the following resources helpful:
